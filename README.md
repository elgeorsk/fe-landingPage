## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `assets/js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions below.
